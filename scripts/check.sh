# The definition of "done" for one unit of work. Exits non-zero on any failure.
#
# WHY THIS IS LONGER THAN fmt/clippy/test
# ---------------------------------------
# Those three were the obvious candidates and they are not sufficient here. On
# 2026-09-26 every defect that reached `testnet` was caught by something that is
# NOT one of them: a ticket id in public source, a migration filename, a file
# growing past the line limit, a commons pin that did not match the lock, and an
# end-to-end failure. A gate that runs three of nine checks and calls the result
# "done" is a green that means less than the one CI already gives us.
#
# So this runs every repository check that can run locally, plus the compiler
# ones, and it REPORTS WHAT IT DID NOT RUN rather than implying full coverage.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU
# -------------------------
# 656 of this workspace's 866 tests pass locally. The other 210 are `#[ignore]`d
# and need a live Postgres and Redis; CI runs them with --run-ignored and they
# gate merges the same as any other test. The end-to-end suite needs a real
# server and the pinned client image on top of that.
#
# So a green run here means "nothing local objects", not "this is mergeable".
# The difference is about a quarter of the gating tests, and it includes the
# tenant-isolation suite. Set DATABASE_URL and TEST_REDIS_URL to close most of
# the gap; the script says so at the end when they are unset.
