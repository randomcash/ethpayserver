# Refuse a commons pin that is not on payserver-commons main.
#
# A cross-repo ticket pins commons by branch sha before the commons PR merges.
# Merge ethpayserver first (or forget to re-pin) and the workspace ends up
# pinned to a commit that lives only on the commons branch - and once that
# branch is deleted by a squash merge, the commit is gone for good. Nothing
# fails at merge time: the build stays green until the next clean checkout
# tries to resolve the pin and finds nothing there.
#
# Commons is public, so this needs no token - an anonymous, blobless clone of
# `main` is enough to walk its commit graph.
#
# Must-fail-first, run against real payserver-commons commits (2026-09-14):
#   - pin set to a commons commit that existed only on an unmerged branch
#     (sha 1319b2a7b018397a23afc6f157b791a699590eb3, redacted branch name -
#     this repo is public) -> exit 1, "is not on commons main".
#   - pin set to 780dd224d5f756901f45efe68fdd5bb4c7f416ff (this repo's actual
#     pin, on main) -> exit 0, "is on payserver-commons main".
#   - one crate line left on the branch-only sha while the rest were reverted
#     to the main sha (partial re-pin) -> exit 1, reporting only the
#     offending rev and "ok" for the rest.
#   - a commons line pinned with a short sha (e.g. rev = "048acab", what
#     `git log --oneline` and GitHub's UI show by default) -> exit 1, "is not
#     a full 40-character sha", instead of being silently skipped while a
#     full-sha line elsewhere satisfies the "some rev was found" check.
