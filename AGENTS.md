# Rules for a coding session

You are one session working on one feature. Read this, then
`memos/spec.md`, `memos/progress.md`, and `git log --oneline -20`.

## The loop

1. Run `scripts/check.sh`. **If it fails, fix that first and do nothing else.**
   You did not break it, and leaving it broken makes the next session unable to
   tell their failure from yours.
2. Work on **only** your assigned feature. Do not refactor unrelated code, however
   tempting — an unrelated change in the same commit is indistinguishable from the
   feature when someone bisects.
3. **Write the test first**, then the code, until `scripts/check.sh` passes.
4. In `memos/features.json`, change only the `passes` field of your feature.
5. Add a session entry to `memos/progress.md`.
6. Commit with `git commit -S`. Message: `F00X: <what changed>`.
7. Report back: feature id, pass or fail, files changed, and anything the next
   session must know.

## Rules that are not negotiable

**Never delete, skip (`#[ignore]`), or weaken a test to make a check pass.** If a
test blocks you, either the code is wrong or the test encodes a decision nobody
has revisited. Say which; do not edit it quietly. This rule survived three
attempts to make an exception for it in a single day, and each time the test was
right.

**A test that cannot fail is worse than no test.** Before trusting one, break the
thing it covers and confirm it goes red. Real examples from this repository: an
endpoint that returned 401 regardless of state; a duplicate-id case that failed
at the first statement so there was nothing to roll back; a guard whose own
self-test passed while the thing it guarded was being violated, because the test
used an untracked file the check never looks at.

**A unit test does not prove the feature is reachable.** Test it through the entry
point a caller actually uses. Three separate pieces of this repository shipped
fully tested and wired to nothing, every one with green tests. `pub` is not
reachability.

**State the method, not just the result.** "I verified X" is not useful without
what you ran and against what. A measurement against the wrong base, a query
with a limit that hid the rows, a log that was the wrong place to look — each of
those produced a confident wrong answer here within one day.

**Never `git add -A`.** Check `git status --short | grep '^??'` and add paths
explicitly. Build artefacts and symlinked `node_modules` have nearly been
committed that way.

## This repository is public

No ticket ids or tracker links in source — not in code, comments, doc comments
or test names. No session urls. No secrets, internal hostnames or private paths.
No reproduction for an unfixed vulnerability: describe the property now enforced
and leave the exploit in the private tracker.

**Some work belongs in the private repository rather than this one.** If you are
not certain a piece of work belongs here, ask before writing it — including
before naming a branch, writing a commit message, or titling a pull request, all
of which are public the moment they are pushed and cannot be retracted. The
private tracker says which work this applies to; this file deliberately does
not, because a rule that lists what it conceals discloses it.

Do not name any tool or vendor in a file, comment, or commit message.

## Conventions that bite

- **`git grep`, not bare `grep`.** `grep` here honours `.gitignore` and silently
  skips files. That has produced false "clean" results on leak scans.
- **`/tmp` is a RAM-backed tmpfs.** Never build there. A stale build directory
  filled it, and the consequences were a corrupted inter-process message, an
  unsignable commit, and a failed deploy that took the API down. Use `/var/tmp`.
- **Editing a migration changes its checksum** and breaks every deploy, including
  editing a comment. Renaming the file is free; changing its bytes is not.
- **Two migrations must never share a version number.** Branches opened the same
  day collide easily and each is green alone.
- **Commons is pinned by revision.** A change there does not reach this repo
  until the pin moves. Run `scripts/commons.sh unlink` before verifying, or a
  green build proves nothing about the pin.

## Sensitive paths

Auth, crypto, `evm/`, wallet and key derivation, migrations, and the invoice,
payment, payout and refund handlers. Work in them normally, but **say so
prominently in the commit message**. These are human-reviewed without exception.

## What "done" means

`scripts/check.sh` exits zero **and** a test covers the feature. That script does
not run the integration suite without `DATABASE_URL`, and never runs end-to-end.
It prints what it skipped. A green run is not the same as mergeable, and
reporting it as such is the failure this file exists to prevent.
