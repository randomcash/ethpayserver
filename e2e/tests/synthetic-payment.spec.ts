/**
 * Synthetic payment against the live testnet deployment (RCS-112).
 *
 * The one test in the suite that exercises the money path for real: it creates
 * invoices over the API, broadcasts actual Sepolia transactions to the
 * addresses the server derived, waits for `paid` on the public checkout
 * WebSocket, and asserts the store webhook fired with a valid signature.
 * Everything else in the repo stops short of an on-chain payment.
 *
 * Three invoices, not one, and all on the same store and payment method: the
 * addresses the server hands out come from one xpub and one counter, and when
 * that counter was wrong two invoices were quoted the same address (RCS-235,
 * RCS-234). One invoice per run can never see that. The assertions below are
 * therefore as much about *which* invoice each payment paid as about payment
 * working at all.
 *
 * Run:
 *   E2E_REMOTE=true E2E_SYNTHETIC_PAYMENT=true npx playwright test tests/synthetic-payment.spec.ts
 *
 * Off by default — it spends real (testnet) ETH and needs secrets, so the
 * in-pipeline `e2e` job must not pick it up. When it *is* switched on, missing
 * configuration is a hard failure rather than a skip: a silently-skipped money
 * path is exactly the gap this ticket exists to close. The pure arithmetic it
 * leans on lives in `fixtures/synthetic-payment.ts` and is unit-tested in
 * `synthetic-payment-helpers.spec.ts`, which does run everywhere.
 *
 * Funds are recoverable. The store's xpub is `m/44'/60'/0'` of
 * `E2E_TEST_MNEMONIC`, so every address the server derives (`0/{index}`) is
 * spendable from the same mnemonic; the spender lives at a separate account
 * index and is topped up from a faucet.

       *   replaces the first instead of paying its own invoice.
       * - concurrency *hides* the bug this run exists to catch. If two invoices
       *   share an address, paying both at once still turns both green; paying
       *   one and then checking the others are still unpaid is what makes a
