// `store_roles` holds the four global default roles (`store_id IS NULL`) seeded

// every store creation answered HTTP 500 and every test needing a store failed.

// Listing the table is not the only way to lose it: TRUNCATE ... CASCADE
// truncates referencing tables wholesale and follows the chain, so truncating
// `users` reaches `stores` (via `stores.owner_id`) and `stores` reaches
// `store_roles`. Row-level DELETEs cascade per row instead, which takes the
// per-store roles and leaves the defaults.
