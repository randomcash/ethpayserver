/**
 * Reclaim funds parked by the synthetic-payment test.
 *
 * Each nightly run sends three payments of a random 0.00005-0.00015 ETH from
 * the spender (m/44'/60'/9'/0/0) to addresses the server derived from the
 * merchant xpub at m/44'/60'/0'/0/{i}. Both come from the same seed, so that
 * principal is never actually spent — only gas is. This walks the derived
 * addresses and sends anything worth moving back to the spender.
 *
 * The indices march outwards, three per night, and never restart. They used to:
 * the counter lived on the payment method, so a fresh store began at 0 and the
 * parked funds piled up on the first few addresses. The counter moved
 * onto an account-level wallet keyed by the xpub, which is the whole point -
 * one key, one counter, no reuse - so a fresh store now continues wherever that
 * key left off. The scan has to cover the entire history rather than a window
 * near zero, and a range that stops short does not fail: it silently reports
 * nothing to sweep while the funds sit past the end of it.
 *
 * Hence --scan 1000 by default, which is over three years of nightlies at three
 * payments a night. Raise it rather than trim it; each index is one RPC call.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of the test: a failed sweep must not fail a run whose
 * payment already succeeded, and best-effort cleanup inside an assertion is how
 * things quietly stop working. Run it occasionally instead — once a year is
 * plenty, since gas is the only real burn.
 *
 *   E2E_TEST_MNEMONIC="..." E2E_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://..." \
 *     node scripts/sweep-test-wallet.mjs [--scan 1000] [--execute]
 *
 * Dry run by default: it prints what it would move and sends nothing. Pass
 * --execute to actually broadcast.
 *
 * ## Emptying the wallet entirely
 *
 *   ... node scripts/sweep-test-wallet.mjs --to 0xabc... [--execute]
 *
 * `--to` changes where the consolidation lands and adds the spender itself to
 * the sweep, which the default run deliberately leaves alone - it is the
 * wallet the nightly pays *from*, so draining it would stop the suite.
 *
 * ## Tokens, and why they go first
 *
 * `--token 0x...` (repeatable) sweeps an ERC-20 balance as well. It runs
 * *before* the ether pass, and the order is not a preference: moving a token
 * costs gas, gas is paid in ether by the address holding the token, and the
 * ether pass leaves each address with nothing. Sweep ether first and any
 * token on that address is stranded on a key you are about to throw away.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. The wallet this script was extended to recover
 * had 60 USDC sitting on an address holding 2.5 ETH; an ether-only sweep
 * would have taken the ether and left the tokens unreachable forever.
 *
 * That is the point of the flag: it exists for rotation. The phrase behind
 * this wallet lives only as a GitHub Actions secret and was never written
 * down, so a run with `--to` is how the balance leaves a wallet nobody can
 * open, and it necessarily runs inside CI where that secret resolves. See
 * `.github/workflows/e2e-wallet-recover.yml`.
