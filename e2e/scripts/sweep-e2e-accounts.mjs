/**
 * Remove the accounts abandoned mid-registration against a live deployment.
 *
 * `tests/scout.spec.ts` (and, for a few days before it was disabled here,
 * the scheduled workflow's own `browser` job) registers a fresh passkey
 * account on every run. Most of what it exercises never gets further than
 * that: no email, no wallet, no store. Each one is small, but there is no
 * job that ever removes them, so they only ever accumulate.
 *
 * This targets exactly that residue: accounts with no email and no wallet
 * address - the two things that would let a real owner reach one - that also
 * own no store at all, or whose every store is one of the
 * `synthetic-payment.spec.ts` runs this sweep's sibling
 * (`sweep-e2e-stores.mjs`) already knows how to name and clear. The email/
 * wallet check matters on its own: a merchant who signed up with real
 * contact details but has not created a first store yet would otherwise look
 * identical to this residue on the store check alone. Deletion goes through
 * `DELETE /admin/users/{id}`
 * (`server/src/api/admin/mod.rs`), the same cascade a merchant gets from
 * `DELETE /users/me` - it refuses on its own if the account ever took a
 * payment, payout or refund, so this script cannot use it to destroy
 * financial history even by mistake.
 *
 *   E2E_API_URL=https://testnet.random.cash E2E_REMOTE=true \
 *   E2E_API_TOKEN=ak_... node scripts/sweep-e2e-accounts.mjs [--execute]
 *
 * The token must belong to a ServerAdmin - the admin endpoints this script
 * calls refuse anyone else. Dry run by default: it lists what it would
 * remove and changes nothing. Only `--execute` issues deletes, because this
 * runs against a live server and the rows are real.
