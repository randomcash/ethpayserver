/**
 * Archive the stores the e2e runs left behind.
 *
 * The synthetic-payment spec and the full e2e suite create stores on every run
 * and for a long time removed none of them. This archives them: out of
 * `GET /stores`, closed to new invoices, but the row and its payment history
 * stay, and `POST /stores/{id}/unarchive` brings one back. Like BTCPay, nothing
 * here destroys history.
 *
 *   E2E_API_URL=https://testnet.random.cash E2E_REMOTE=true \
 *   E2E_API_TOKEN=ak_... node scripts/sweep-e2e-stores.mjs [--execute]
 *
 * Dry run by default: it lists what it would archive and changes nothing. Only
 * `--execute` archives, because this runs against a live server.
 *
 * - `GET /stores` returns only the live stores the token's own user can see, so
 *   this can never reach another account's stores, and an already-archived
 *   store is not listed again.
 * - It calls the self-service `DELETE /stores/{id}`, which archives, so any
 *   token able to manage the store works; no admin token is needed. Because
 *   archiving is reversible the old exact-timestamp gate is gone: every store
 *   named `e2e-...` is swept. A store without that prefix is never touched.
 * - It does not call `DELETE /admin/stores/{id}` (a hard delete, still gated to
 *   the synthetic name shape on the server). That is the escape hatch, not
 *   this script's job.
