#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]

//! Capability 3 (`invoice_create`), through the production issuer, against a
//! real database.
//!
//! `host_calls.rs`'s own tests drive `PluginHostCalls::invoice_create` end to
//! end, but through a hand-written `FixedIssuer` double that just echoes back
//! whatever it is asked - they prove the JSON dispatch layer forwards a
//! request correctly, and nothing about whether `PluginHostApi`, the type
//! `server.rs` actually publishes at boot, creates a real, payable invoice
//! from it. A bug in `PluginHostApi::invoice_create` itself - the wrong
//! store, a lost decimal converting to the smallest unit, a currency that
//! does not match the payment method it was priced against - would pass
//! every one of those tests, because none of them touch this type.
//!
//! This is the same shape any merchant's customer would pay: a store with a
//! real wallet-backed payment method, invoiced through the exact function a
//! wasm plugin's `invoice_create` import resolves to (see the doc comment on
//! `PluginHostApi`), then read back through the same repositories the rest
//! of the server uses.
