#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]

//! Review finding, fixed: `create_api_key` is the endpoint that accepts and
//! returns the permission list, and every piece of it was tested alone -
//! `validate_requested_permissions` and `requested_scope` as pure functions,
//! `create_api_key_with_permissions` against a database - while nothing drove
//! the handler itself. Separately covered halves do not join themselves: a
//! regression that validated one value and persisted another, or that echoed
//! `payload.permissions` back in the response while quietly handing `None` to
//! the writer, would have compiled and passed every one of those tests. The
//! caller would then hold a key the API told them was narrowed and the
//! database treats as unrestricted, which is the failure worth catching.
//!
//! These drive the real handler and assert the three things agree: what was
//! requested, what was persisted, and what the response claims.
