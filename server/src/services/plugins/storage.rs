//! Schema-per-plugin storage: creation, migrations, and a scoped connection
//! handle.
//!
//! Copies BTCPay's `BaseDbContextFactory<T>` shape: each plugin gets its own
//! Postgres schema and ships its own migrations, which the host runs on
//! install and upgrade. A plugin never gets a connection to `public` — see
//! [`PluginSchema::acquire`] for what that scoping does and does not buy.
//!
//! ## For plugin authors: migration checksums are baked in at compile time
//!
//! `sqlx` records a SHA-384 of each migration file's *bytes* the first time
//! it applies, and refuses to run again if that checksum ever changes — this
//! is the same trap documented for the host's own migrations in this repo's
//! `CLAUDE.md`, and it applies identically to a plugin's own migrations
//! directory. Once a plugin build has shipped a migration and it has run
//! against even one installation, editing that file — including something
//! as small as fixing a comment or reformatting whitespace — breaks every
//! future install or upgrade against a database where it already applied.
//! Add a new migration instead of editing an old one; renaming an
//! unapplied file is free, changing its bytes is not.
