//! Capability 7: tell an account something, without ever handing a plugin a
//! recipient to name.
//!
//! Before this, a plugin's only way to reach a merchant at all was the
//! checkout itself: refuse an invoice and let the refusal text carry the
//! whole message. A merchant who never opens the page that would have shown
//! them a warning hears nothing until that refusal - which is the same
//! moment a customer's payment fails.
//!
//! A plugin cannot send email. It has no host capability that takes a
//! recipient, and it should not get one - a plugin holding an arbitrary
//! address is a mail relay wearing a billing plugin's name. What this grants
//! instead is narrower: an account id the host already recognises, and a
//! subject and body the host delivers through whichever channel and to
//! whichever address it looks up itself. The plugin never sees either.
//!
//! No new type here for the message content - see [`AccountNotice`] in
//! `crate::services::email`, re-exported alongside the other capabilities'
//! names, the same way capability 1 re-exports `data_service`'s type instead
//! of duplicating it.
//!
//! Right now there is exactly one channel: the address on the account, by
//! email. A wallet-only account has none, and [`notice_address`] says so
//! rather than the notice being silently dropped - a caller that cannot tell
//! "delivered" from "nowhere to deliver to" would have no way to decide
//! whether that is worth surfacing to an operator.
//!
//! Not yet reachable from a plugin, but the gap is now one mechanical step
//! rather than an unstarted one. `payserver-plugin-host`'s `PluginHostCalls`
//! trait has gained an `account_notice` method and a matching wasm import
//! (`define_answering_call`, the same helper `invoice_create` and
//! `merchant_volume` use), tested the same way those two are - instantiate a
//! module that imports only `account_notice` and check the request reaches
//! that method and no other. None of that is visible to this repo yet:
//! `payserver-plugin-host` is pinned by revision in this repo's
//! `Cargo.toml`, and a change there does not reach here until the pin moves,
//! which needs the commons change merged first - a same-session commit on a
//! branch that could still be rebased is not something a pin should ever
//! point at. Once the pin does move, wiring this repo's side is: implement
//! `account_notice` on [`super::host_calls::PluginCalls`], the same shape as
//! `issuer`/`volume` there (a `DeferredNotifier` cell, since building a
//! [`PluginAccountNotifier`] needs the full `PgAppState` that is not ready
//! at plugin-registration time either), and call [`AccountNotifier::notify_account`]
//! from it. No design decision is open at that point, only the wiring.
//!
//! Deciding *when* to call this is a second, independent gap: the
//! thresholds that would trigger a warning are a billing plan's own config,
//! not host state. Neither this repository nor `payserver-commons` names a
//! plan, a bracket or a per-plan warning window anywhere (`git grep` finds
//! nothing in either checkout). The host side of invoice creation is
//! structurally blind to the same thing - `InvoiceCreationFilterRequest`
//! carries a store id and an account id and nothing else, so even the
//! decision to *refuse* an invoice already happens entirely inside the
//! plugin, opaque to this process. That decision belongs entirely to the
//! billing plugin's own source, which is in neither checkout this worker
//! has. A caller added here would have to invent the trigger it is calling
//! on, which is a second product decision wearing this ticket's name.
