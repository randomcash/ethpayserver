//! What a plugin's host imports actually do.
//!
//! The wasm side of this is in `payserver-plugin-host`: a plugin calls
//! `storage_query` or `invoice_create`, gets a length back, and copies the
//! answer out with `host_take`. This is the other end.
//!
//! That wasm-to-host wiring - a compiled guest module actually reaching this
//! layer through wasmtime, not just a Rust-level call to it - is not code in
//! this repository, so it cannot be shown in a diff here: the linker that
//! binds the `storage_query` import lives in `payserver-plugin-host::runtime`
//! (the crate this workspace pins by `rev` in the root `Cargo.toml`), and the
//! guest-side round trip is exercised end to end, through a real compiled
//! wasm module and a real `wasmtime::Linker`, by
//! `a_plugin_can_ask_the_host_a_question_and_read_the_answer` in that crate's
//! `runtime.rs` tests. Combined with this file's own tests against a real
//! `PluginCalls` and a real Postgres, the two repositories together cover the
//! whole path a plugin's write actually takes; neither alone does.
//!
//! Two capabilities, and they are not alike. Storage runs SQL on a
//! connection Postgres authenticated as *that plugin's* role, and the
//! database is what confines it. Invoicing has no such backstop - it writes
//! to the money path - so its confinement is that the plugin cannot name a
//! store. See [`PluginCalls::invoice_create`].
//!
//! # The storage contract
//!
//! Request:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"statements": [
//!   {"sql": "UPDATE subscriptions SET paid_until = $1::timestamptz WHERE account_id = $2",
//!    "params": ["2026-11-01T00:00:00Z", "acct-7"]}
//! ]}
//! ```
//!
//! Response:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"results": [{"rows_affected": "1", "rows": []}]}
//! ```
//!
//! Four rules, each of which exists for a specific reason:
//!
//! **One call is one transaction.** Every statement in `statements` runs in
//! order inside a single transaction, and the whole thing commits or none of
//! it does. That is not a convenience: billing has to advance `paid_until`
//! *and* record which invoice paid for it, and a crash between those two
//! either credits a merchant twice or loses their payment. A plugin cannot
//! hold a transaction open across calls, because a transaction that outlived
//! a call could hold locks until its deadline with nothing running.
//!
//! **Parameters are bound, never pasted.** Injection is close to moot inside
//! a plugin's own schema - the role cannot reach anything else - but binding
//! keeps one entry to genuinely one statement, since Postgres's extended
//! protocol will not run two.
//!
//! **Every value is a string, both directions.** Parameters arrive as
//! strings and the SQL says what they are (`$1::timestamptz`); results must
//! be text and the SQL says so (`paid_until::text`). The symmetry is not
//! aesthetic. Amounts are `NUMERIC(38,18)`, and a JSON number is an IEEE-754
//! double: `129.000000000000000000` does not survive the round trip. Making
//! every value a string removes the question rather than answering it
//! per-type, and Postgres renders `NUMERIC` to text exactly.
//!
//! A column that is not text is an error naming the column and telling the
//! author to cast it, rather than a silently lossy conversion.
//!
//! Note the shape of that check: it happens per row, so a query that returns
//! **no rows** never exercises it. An author testing against an empty table
//! will see an uncast query succeed and the same query fail once there is
//! data. That is inherent - there is nothing to convert in zero rows - and it
//! is called out here so it reads as a documented edge rather than a bug
//! discovered in production.
//!
//! **The answer is capped.** A plugin can write `SELECT * FROM everything`,
//! and without a limit the host would materialise it, serialise it, and copy
//! it into wasm memory.
