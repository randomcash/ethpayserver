//! Capability 2: a filter that can refuse invoice creation, and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! This is how a lapsed subscription is enforced - the merchant keeps
//! everything except creating new invoices. It must never grow into a hook
//! for payment detection, crediting or confirmation: refusing a lapsed
//! merchant's *new* invoice is a billing decision, but withholding credit for
//! a payment a customer already sent takes that customer's money over a
//! dispute they are not party to.
//!
//! That is enforced structurally, not by convention: [`InvoiceCreationFilter`]
//! has exactly one method, and the only thing it is ever asked about is
//! [`InvoiceCreationFilterRequest`], which carries a store id and nothing
//! else - there is no field to name a payment, a confirmation or a credit.
//! Widening this to a generic `filter(hook, payload)` call is exactly the
//! shape that would let a future change smuggle in a payment-touching hook
//! without anyone deciding to; see the test below.
