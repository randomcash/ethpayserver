//! Invoice cleanup service.
//!
//! Handles invoice lifecycle cleanup:
//! - Expires pending invoices that have passed their expiration time
//! - Unwatches addresses for completed invoices (expired, paid, cancelled)
//! - Sends webhook notifications when invoices expire
//!
//! Triggered by:
//! - Block events from any chain (via EventConsumer)
//! - Periodic fallback timer
