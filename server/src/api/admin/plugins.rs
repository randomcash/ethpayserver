//! The plugin lifecycle over HTTP: install, upgrade, enable, disable,
//! uninstall, and the record of who did what.
//!
//! Until this existed a plugin could only be installed by writing an
//! `installed_plugins` row and placing an artifact on disk by hand - which is
//! precisely the "an admin should never need filesystem access" failure this
//! whole area exists to avoid.
//!
//! ## Installing does not load
//!
//! An install writes the artifact, the row and an audit event, and stops
//! there. The plugin loads on the next boot. This is a deliberate copy of
//! BTCPay's model: hot-reload is a large complication for something done
//! rarely, and swapping a wasmtime instance underneath a request in flight is
//! exactly the kind of machinery that fails at 3am. Every mutating response
//! therefore carries `restart_required`, and it is the honest answer rather
//! than a limitation to be papered over.
//!
//! Disabling is the exception, and the asymmetry is on purpose: an admin
//! switching off a misbehaving plugin means *stop running it now*. That one
//! takes effect in the live process as well as in the database.
//!
//! ## The upload is JSON, not multipart
//!
//! A wasm module is binary, and multipart is the conventional shape for it.
//! It would mean adding `multer` to the dependency tree for one endpoint,
//! where base64 in a JSON body is already expressible with a crate the tree
//! carries, is trivial to drive from a test or a script without an encoder,
//! and keeps the request a single atomic document - manifest and module
//! together, so there is no state where one arrived and the other did not.
//! The cost is a third more bytes on the wire for an operation performed
//! rarely.
