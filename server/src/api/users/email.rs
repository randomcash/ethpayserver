//! Email change: request, confirm, remove.
//!
//! SENSITIVE: this touches account recovery. Set, change and remove all sit
//! behind `FreshlyAuthenticatedUser` (server/src/api/extractors.rs) rather than
//! `AuthenticatedUser` - a session hijacked hours into its lifetime must not be
//! able to swap the account's recovery address. None of this touches
//! `kdf_salt_identifier`: it is set once at registration and is immutable
//! (enforced in `auth::UserRepository::update_user`), and the recovery KDF
//! stays salted with whatever identifier was pinned then regardless of what
//! `email` becomes later. That is what makes changing email safe at all.
