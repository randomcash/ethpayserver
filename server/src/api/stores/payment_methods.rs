/// the operator adding `tron:...` to that list; this predicate does not
/// change.
///
/// `settings` is `None` when nobody has ever written a `server_settings`
/// row - confirmed true of the live testnet database, and unverified but
/// plausibly also true of mainnet (see the ticket's audit). Nothing in this
/// codebase says which environment a given binary is running as, so the
/// fallback below cannot use one fixed chain set for both callers - it
/// answers a different question depending on `context`:
///
/// - `New`: checked against `evm::testnet`'s registry only. A request
///   introducing a chain id is exactly the case that must not guess - an
///   unconfigured mainnet deployment must refuse every chain until an
///   operator writes `enabled_chain_ids` (mainnet chain ids are never
///   testnet chain ids, so this still refuses them), while an unconfigured
///   testnet deployment keeps accepting its one real chain, Sepolia
///   (`eip155:11155111`), without requiring that same operator step first.
///   Earlier versions of this fallback used `ServerSettings::default()`
///   (a Rust-side EVM-*mainnet* list that does not contain Sepolia, so it
///   turned "reject Tron" into "reject testnet's only real chain"),
///   `is_evm()` (accepted any invented `eip155:<n>`), and
///   `evm::get_any_chain_config` (accepted a mainnet chain id, e.g.
///   `eip155:1`, on the Sepolia-only testnet deployment - the exact hole
///   this ticket exists to close, reopened for mainnet chains instead of
///   Tron). All three are wrong for the same reason: none of them can tell
///   testnet and mainnet apart, so each was safe for one and not the other.
/// - `Existing`: checked against the full compiled registry
///   (`evm::get_any_chain_config`, mainnet and testnet). This case is never
///   a value the request chose, so there is no "which environment is this"
///   question to get wrong - the only thing left to catch is a namespace
///   with no adapter anywhere at all (Tron). Using the `New` behavior here
///   too would 400 every update to an already-working row on an
///   unconfigured deployment - re-enabling it, rotating its xpub - the
///   moment `server_settings` is empty, which is new collateral damage this
///   ticket does not need to cause. A stored chain id that the compiled
///   registry recognizes was, by definition, watchable when it was written.
///
/// Either way this is not a substitute for `enabled_chain_ids`: a `Some`
/// settings row always wins, and once an operator writes one, every chain
/// not in it is refused regardless of what `evm` recognizes.
///
/// Without this gate at all a merchant can register e.g. `tron:728126428`,
/// which still derives a secp256k1 address (the same curve as EVM) but that
/// address is never watched - the invoice can be paid and is never marked so.
