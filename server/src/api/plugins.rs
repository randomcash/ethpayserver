//! Mounts installed plugins' declared routes under the reserved
//! `/plugins/{id}` prefix, with the host's own authentication
//! applied before any plugin code runs.
//!
//! [`PluginRegistry`] is the load-time gate for which manifests
//! this host accepts; it knows nothing about HTTP. This module is what turns
//! "registered" into "reachable": each plugin's own router is nested under
//! its [`PluginId`], which is validated (no path separators, no empty
//! labels) as exactly what makes that prefix safe to reserve — see
//! `payserver_plugin_api::PluginId`. The `/plugins` prefix itself is applied
//! by [`router()`], not left to whoever calls it, so the reservation is
//! structural rather than a convention a future call site could forget.
//!
//! Two segments are reserved under a plugin's prefix, and the split is not
//! cosmetic:
//!
//! - `/plugins/{id}/pages/{path}` serves the [`PageElement`] tree a plugin
//!   returns from its `render_page` export. It is mounted by
//!   [`super::router`], not here, and [`get_page`] is its handler.
//! - `/plugins/{id}/routes/...` is the plugin's own declared router, nested
//!   by [`router()`] below.
//!
//! Without that second segment they would overlap, and overlap here fails
//! silently in the worse direction: axum prefers a static nest to a dynamic
//! route, so a plugin that declared any router at all would shadow the
//! host's page endpoint for its own id, and a merchant would get that
//! plugin's 404 where their billing page should be. Giving each a segment of
//! its own means neither can reach the other, whichever gets mounted first.
//!
//! Nothing in this build can ask a loaded plugin for its own router: the
//! wasmtime runtime instantiates and calls plugins, but no entry point
//! produces a router. `declared_routes` is therefore supplied by the caller
//! — today always empty in the live server — as the seam a future slice
//! fills in once a plugin can actually produce one. Pages do not go through
//! it and never did.
//!
//! Auth is a [`middleware::from_fn_with_state`] layer wrapped around each
//! plugin's *entire* nest, not a per-handler extractor a plugin's own code
//! could omit: a plugin must not get a say in who is authenticated, and a
//! layer runs before the plugin's router at all, including for a sub-path
//! the plugin itself does not recognize. It reuses [`AuthenticatedUser`],
//! the exact extractor every core handler already goes through, so a plugin
//! is held to the same authentication as the rest of the host. The
//! authenticated `UserInfo` — identity and role — is then inserted into
//! the request's extensions before the plugin's router runs, so a future
//! plugin handler can read who is calling via `Extension<UserInfo>` instead
//! of asserting it itself.
//!
//! A plugin id absent from [`PluginRegistry`] has nothing mounted for its
//! prefix: a request under it falls through to the app's ordinary 404,
//! never to a core route and never a 500.
