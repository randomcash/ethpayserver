//! Shared database access for tests.
//!
//! A test that needs Postgres is run on purpose (`#[ignore]`d, and CI passes
//! `--run-ignored`). If the database is missing or down, that run must fail:
//! a helper that quietly returns `None` makes "11 passed" and "11 skipped"
//! the same output, and the suite goes green by not existing.
//!
//! Every database test connects through here. `scripts/check-test-db-skips.sh`
//! rejects the old `env::var("DATABASE_URL").ok()?` / `.connect(..).await.ok()?`
//! shapes anywhere else.
//!
//! A skip that is genuinely wanted (a test that is not ignored but can use a
//! database when one is present) goes through [`database_url_or_skip`], which
//! prints a fixed `SKIPPED:` line so skips can be counted in a CI log.
