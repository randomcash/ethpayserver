//! `ServerSettingsRepository`, against a real database.
//!
//! These exist because the read path was broken from the day the
//! `enabled_chain_ids` column became a `caip2[]` domain, and nothing caught
//! it. The column is an array of a DOMAIN over text; sqlx decodes by type
//! OID, so asking for `Vec<String>` off a `caip2[]` fails every time, whatever
//! the values are.
//!
//! It stayed invisible because no settings row ever existed on any instance:
//! `fetch_optional` returned `None`, the decode never ran, and every caller
//! fell back to `ServerSettings::default()`. The first successful save would
//! have written a row and then crash-looped the process on the next boot,
//! since the decode was an unwrapping `get` in a value read during startup.
//!
//! A unit test could not have found it - there is no `caip2` domain outside a
//! real database - which is exactly why these live here.
