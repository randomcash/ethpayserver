//! Error-telemetry scrubbing for a Sentry-protocol error telemetry backend.
//!
//! random.cash is a crypto payment processor, so error payloads must **never**
//! carry secrets or customer data: wallet/private keys, mnemonics, API keys,
//! JWTs, bearer tokens, emails, on-chain addresses/hashes, HTTP request bodies,
//! or per-user identity. [`scrub_event`] is installed as the Sentry
//! `before_send` hook in every binary that initialises Sentry, [`scrub_log`]
//! as `before_send_log` for the separate structured-logs pipeline, and
//! [`redact_secrets`] redacts secret-shaped substrings from free-text fields.
//!
//! This lives in `evm` (rather than being duplicated per binary) so the
//! `server` and `evmmonitor` binaries share one audited implementation. It is
//! gated behind the `sentry-scrub` feature so the scrubber and its `sentry` /
//! `regex` dependencies are only compiled where Sentry is actually used.
//!
//! # Relationship to the `scrub` crate
//!
//! The same rules exist a second time in payserver-commons `scrub`, as
//! hand-written scanners with no dependencies, because the browser client
//! needs them and `regex` costs ~1 MB of WASM. This regex table stays the
//! audited reference, and `parity_with_shared_scrubber` below asserts the two
//! agree across a corpus — so changing the rules here fails the build until
//! `scrub` follows. That check lives here because this is the only crate
//! where both implementations compile: `evm` pulls in alloy/sqlx and does not
//! build for `wasm32`, which is the whole reason there are two.

///
/// This filter only ever needs to swallow an *isolated* blip, never a
/// persistent failure, because it is not the backstop for a connection that
/// stays down: `ChainMonitor::resubscribe_if_stalled`
/// (`evm/src/monitor/chain/lifecycle.rs`) already watches for that on its own
/// clock, independent of anything `alloy_transport_ws` or `alloy_pubsub` logs
/// or doesn't log. It resubscribes and logs its own `error!` under
/// `evm::monitor::chain::lifecycle` - a target this filter never touches -
/// once a block stream has gone silent for `stall_timeout`. So a transient
/// reset stays a breadcrumb, and a connection that never recovers pages
/// within one stall window regardless of what the WS layer's own retry logic
/// happens to be doing underneath it. `our_own_errors_still_page` covers that
/// target generically, and `evm/tests/stalled_stream_still_pages.rs` drives a
/// real stall through a real `ChainMonitor` to confirm
/// `resubscribe_if_stalled`'s own `error!` resolves to a paging event, not
/// just a hand-typed target string.
///
/// An earlier version of this filter argued instead that `alloy_pubsub`'s own
/// service loop (`alloy_pubsub::service`) always logs a paging `error!` when
/// *it* gives up retrying, and used that as the backstop. That turned out not
/// to hold in general: `evm/tests/ws_pubsub_retry_escalation.rs` runs the
/// real `alloy_pubsub`/`alloy_transport_ws` retry loop (pinned to `alloy =
/// "1.0"`, resolved in `Cargo.lock` to 1.8.3) against a WS server that
/// completes the handshake and then resets every connection, including
/// retries, and `alloy_pubsub::service` never logs at all - it just
/// reconnects, dies, and reconnects again, forever. Traced against that
/// pinned source: `reconnect_with_retries`
/// (`alloy-pubsub-1.8.3/src/service.rs:195`) only counts a `reconnect()` call
/// as a failed attempt if establishing the connection itself errors; a
/// connection that establishes fine and then dies immediately after counts as
/// a *successful* reconnect, so `max_retries` is never approached and the
/// give-up log at `service.rs:205` is never reached. That is a real gap in
/// `alloy_pubsub`, not a defect in this filter - it just means this filter
/// cannot lean on it, which is why the actual backstop is our own
/// `resubscribe_if_stalled` instead.
///
/// `alloy_pubsub_giving_up_still_pages` documents the narrower case where
/// `alloy_pubsub`'s give-up log does still apply - the connection attempt
/// itself fails outright (DNS, refused, TLS) rather than flapping - which
/// still pages correctly since this filter never touches that target either.
/// It is not relied on as the general backstop.
///
/// Only `error!`-level `alloy_transport_ws` events are demoted: the noise
/// this exists to quiet is specifically the `error!` call sites in
/// `alloy_transport_ws::native`, not `debug!`/`trace!` chatter the same
/// target might log, so this filter does not touch those.
///
/// `server::services::webhook::merchant_delivery_failed` is demoted the same
/// way, for an unrelated reason: it's logged only when a webhook job
/// exhausts every retry because the request never reached the merchant's
/// endpoint at all (`WebhookError::Unreachable` - DNS, refused, or timed
/// out) *and* the caller has already checked that failure isn't isolated to
/// payserver's own egress (see
/// `server::services::webhook::service::log_permanent_failure` and
/// `recent_unreachable_are_one_merchant` for that check - a DNS/refused/
/// timeout failure alone can't tell "one merchant is down" from "we can't
/// reach anyone", so this target is only ever chosen once the caller has
/// ruled the latter out). The demoted case is already fully captured by the
/// `webhook_delivery_status="permanent_failed"` metric and the
/// `webhook_deliveries` table row the same call site writes. A non-success
/// response, a payload that failed to serialize, or an `Unreachable` failure
/// that isn't isolated to one store webhook keeps the module's default
/// target instead (see
/// `server::services::webhook::service::permanent_failure_is_merchant_unreachable`), since
/// each of those can reflect a fault in our own signing, request
/// construction, or network egress just as easily as one in the merchant's
/// server, and those must keep paging the same as `log_process_error`'s
/// "Error processing webhook job". Paging on-call for the genuinely-isolated
/// case teaches the same lesson as the WS noise above — ignore Sentry errors
/// — for a condition no payserver engineer can act on.
