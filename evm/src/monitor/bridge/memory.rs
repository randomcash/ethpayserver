//! In-memory event bridge using a durable outbox behind a mutex.
//!
//! Useful for testing and single-process deployments where the monitor
//! runs in the same process as the API server.
//!
//! Supports bidirectional communication:
//! - Events flow from monitor to API server, through a durable outbox that
//!   survives a consumer dropping its stream and resubscribing (unlike the
//!   commands side, which stays a plain broadcast: `watch_retry` already
//!   covers a lost command).
//! - Commands flow from API server to monitor
