//! Which chain family a receiving key belongs to, and everything that decides.
//!
//! A merchant hands this server an *account-level* extended public key -
//! `m/44'/<coin>'/0'`. The BIP-44 coin type is already baked into it and the
//! parent is unreachable, so the key cannot be asked which family it came
//! from. Worse, it cannot be told apart by looking: an Ethereum account xpub
//! and a Tron one are byte-indistinguishable - same base58 alphabet, same
//! `0x0488B21E` version bytes, same length. A merchant pasting into the wrong
//! field gets no feedback, and neither does the server.
//!
//! What the family decides is not cosmetic:
//!
//! | family   | namespace | coin type | address                       |
//! |----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
//! | EVM      | `eip155`  | 60        | `0x…` EIP-55 checksummed hex  |
//! | Tron     | `tron`    | 195       | `T…` base58check, `0x41` tag  |
//!
//! Both are secp256k1 and both take the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash
//! of the uncompressed public key, so the *bytes* of an address are produced
//! identically. Only the coin type and the text encoding differ - which is
//! exactly why getting it wrong is silent. Run an Ethereum account xpub
//! through Tron's encoding and out comes a valid, checksum-correct `T…`
//! address. Money sent there arrives. The merchant's Tron wallet never shows
//! it, because that wallet derives at `m/44'/195'`, and recovering it means
//! re-importing the seed at a non-standard path.
//!
//! So a family is declared when a key is registered and carried everywhere
//! that key goes, rather than guessed at from the key or from the chain a
//! payment happens to be quoted on.
