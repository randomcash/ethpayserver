//! How many RPC calls payment detection makes, as watched addresses grow.
//!
//! Every other test in this crate asks whether a payment was found. None asks
//! how many requests finding it takes — and that shape, calls-per-block
//! against addresses-watched, is what decides whether watching a chain scales.
//!
//! Both halves are now O(1) per block. ERC20 detection puts every watched
//! address into one `eth_getLogs` filter; native detection reads the block
//! once and matches its transfers locally. Neither grows with the number of
//! open invoices.
//!
//! Native detection used to be O(N): one `eth_getBalance` per watched address
//! per block, to find which balances had grown, before reading the block
//! anyway to attribute them. These tests are what made that visible and what
//! keep it from coming back.
//!
//! They pin call counts, not correctness, and state the shape rather than a
//! number an implementation could change innocently.
