//! `evm::telemetry::sentry_event_filter`'s own tests prove it demotes a
//! hand-typed `alloy_transport_ws` target and still pages a hand-typed
//! `evm::monitor::chain::lifecycle` one, and `ws_pubsub_retry_escalation.rs`
//! proves the real `alloy_pubsub` retry loop never escalates on its own
//! against a flapping connection. Neither exercises `resubscribe_if_stalled`
//! itself: this drives a real stall through a real `ChainMonitor` and checks
//! what its own `error!` - emitted by the macro, not typed into a test - is
//! actually resolved to by the real filter. That closes the gap a doc
//! comment can only assert: a connection `alloy_transport_ws` never
//! recovers from still pages, even though every breadcrumb it logs along
//! the way does not.
//!
//! This lives in its own binary, not alongside `monitor_recovery.rs`'s other
//! stall tests, because `tracing`'s callsite-interest cache is process-wide:
//! a sibling test that drives the same `resubscribe_if_stalled` call site on
//! its own thread, with no subscriber installed, can permanently cache that
//! callsite as "nobody's listening" before this test's subscriber ever gets
//! a look at it, and a thread-local `set_default` here does not reliably
//! undo that once it's cached. A dedicated binary means this is the only
//! test that ever touches the call site, so there is nothing to race.
