//! Recovery behavior for a chain monitor whose block stream has silently died.
//!
//! A dropped or half-open WebSocket doesn't always deliver a close frame or an
//! error - sometimes the subscription just stops yielding blocks, forever,
//! with nothing to log and nothing for `select!` to notice. Meanwhile the RPC
//! itself stays reachable, so a health check that asks it directly (as
//! `current_block` does) keeps reporting a live chain. These tests exercise
//! the watchdog that notices the mismatch and reconnects without a process
//! restart.
